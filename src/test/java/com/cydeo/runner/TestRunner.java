// Instructing how and what feature we want to run

// where are the step definitions
//  glue = "com/cydeo/step_definitions"
// do we want to just generate missing step definitions
// dryRun=true will run the test without running all scenario for missing steps
// So you can copy all the missing steps if there is any
// it's like a quick scan of all your feature steps has step definitions or not

// do we want to get json , html report
// do we want to filter the test run according to certain tags
